In this checkpoint, you will completely set up a convolutional neural network using PyTorch. There is both a beginner and advanced option and they differ by offering a different amount of starter code and tips.

## Starter Guide

You should have already cloned this repository so navigate to the Machine Learning folder on your computer and you should find two .ipynb one for begginer and one for advanced. Select which one you would like to use and open it in Google Colab (we will use the GPU resources for faster training). All following information will be found in the notebook.
