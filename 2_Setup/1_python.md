## üêç Step 1: Python

Python is the main language we use to write computer vision code for UMARV. You'll use it to:

- Read images and video streams  
- Detect lanes, cones, and signs  
- Train and run ML models  
- Interact with hardware (Jetson, cameras, etc.)

This is only the setup guide for Python. The basics of Python programming will be covered in the next section [3_Programming](/3_Programming/).
