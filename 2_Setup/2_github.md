## üå± Step 2: Learn Git & GitHub

Git and GitHub let us **collaborate on code**, track changes, and work on the same projects without conflicts.

You'll use Git to:
- Clone the UMARV repositories  
- Create your own branches  
- Push your code for review  
- Pull updates from the team

---

Some important terms:
- **Repository (repo)**: A project folder with all its files and history.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development. You can work on features without affecting the main code.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your changes. You can add messages to describe what you changed.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge your changes into the main codebase. Team members review it before merging.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Clone**: Copying a repository to your local machine to work on it.
- **Push**: Sending your local changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
- **Pull**: Fetching the latest changes from the remote repository to your local machine.
- **Remote**: The version of your repository hosted on GitHub.
- **Local**: The version of your repository on your own computer.

This sets your identity for commits.

### üêô Create a GitHub Account

1. Sign up here:  
   [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)

2. Set your **username** and **email** ‚Äî this is where your code will be stored online and shared with the team.

3. Ask us (Maya or Pranav) to add you to the UMARV GitHub organization.  
   - This gives you access to our repositories.
