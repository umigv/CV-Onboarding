## What is IGVC?
The Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) is an annual event that challenges students to design and build autonomous ground vehicles. The competition focuses on the integration of robotics, ML, and engineering principles to navigate a course with various obstacles and tasks. 

This is the competition we spend the year preparing for, and it is the culmination of our efforts in ARV!
