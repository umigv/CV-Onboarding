# CV 2024-25 Project Ideas
These are some ideas for the CV team last year. Not all of these were implemented, but they can help you understand what kinds of projects we can work on. 
## ðŸŸ¢ Level 1

(Hands-on, easy to start, quick results)

* **Classical Vision** â€“ Experiment with classical computer vision techniques (not deep learning) for lane/obstacle detection.

* **Custom Data Augmentations** â€“ Implement creative augmentations to grow the dataset.

* **Clustering Algorithms** â€“ Clean up segmentation masks with clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.

## ðŸŸ¡ Level 2

(Requires some ML/CV knowledge, integration, and optimization)

* **U-Net for Segmentation** â€“ Build and train a custom segmentation model (U-Net is the name of the architecture) in PyTorch.

* **YOLOv8/9/10 Models** â€“ Train and fine-tune object detection models for lanes, cones, etc.

* **Debugger UI** â€“ Build a central dashboard for robot diagnostics and camera feeds.

## ðŸ”´ Level 3

(Research-heavy, high compute demand, or system-level complexity)

* **RNNs for CV** â€“ Add temporal memory (LSTMs/GRUs) to improve real-time inference.

* **Vision Transformers (ViT)** â€“ Fine-tune efficient ViTs for segmentation with large/semi-supervised datasets.

* **Isaac Sim for RL** â€“ Train reinforcement learning models in Nvidia Isaac or simulated digital twins.
