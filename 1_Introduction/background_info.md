This background information will get you situated with the ultimate goal for our vehicle: winning the IGVC! 
It will take you through more information about the competition, the algorithm we implemented for CV last year.
As you're reading this, please start to think about ideas you have for changes and what you might like to work on this year.

# Reflection on Last Year
Most of ARV's issues in the past have had to deal with integration between teams. Each team has historically been good at creating awesome solutions on their own but we have never gotten them to work well together. This is why we are going to need a lot of hands working on the integration of our systems and aleviate some of that stress off of the navigation team. We have also had issues with not being well rounded enough in our dataset collection which made our models subject to issues at competition where conditions are different. Those are the two places where we consistently struggle and need to stay focused on those topics so that we can create our best performing robot.
