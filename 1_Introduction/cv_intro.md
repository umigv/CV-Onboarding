This is a basic tutorial showing and implementing various classical CV algorithms and techniques through OpenCV. 
Even though you might not be working on a classical CV algorithm, it helps to get you oriented with our subteam's focus. 

- [Image Processing Techniques](https://towardsdatascience.com/computer-vision-for-beginners-part-2-29b3f9151874 ). Have a Python file, google colab, jupiter notebook, or other python development environment open and follow along with the article. Once you have finished, you should have a cheat sheet for techniques we often use on the team.
