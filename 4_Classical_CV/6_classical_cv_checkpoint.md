# Checkpoint 4 - Classical CV
Congrats on making it to the **fourth checkpoint**!

* This checkpoint is a google colab notebook with a CV task.
* You will need to get close enough output to Pranav's solution to pass this checkpoint.
* You can use all the resources in this section and go online as well if required.

**Important**: Make a copy of the notebook to your own Google Drive before starting to edit it. You can do this by going to `File -> Save a copy in Drive`. The changes you make in the original notebook will not be saved.
