# Checkpoint 3 - Programming
Congratulations on reaching the **third checkpoint**! 🎉

## 🚀 Build a Game!

Hey team 👋  

For this checkpoint, we’re going to do something a little fun: **build a simple game in Python**. 

---

## 📝 The Challenge
- Build a **small, working game** using Python.  
- Use **classes and objects** somewhere in your code (so we can flex those OOP muscles 💪).   

Some starter ideas:
- Tic Tac Toe
- Number Guessing Game
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Hangman
- A simple text-based adventure

But feel free to come up with your own idea if you’re feeling creative.  

---

## ⏱️ Time Limit
You’ve got about **90 minutes** to work on this.  
It’s meant to be short, scrappy, and fun — don’t worry about perfection.

---

## 🤝 Work Style
- You can work **solo**, or pair up in teams of **2**.  
- If you’re in a team, make sure **both of you contribute to the code**.

---

## 📦 Submitting Your Game
- Push your code to a **new branch** in the onboarding repo. 
    - if you're unsure how to do this, ask Pranav for help!
- Name your branch something like: `checkpoint-3-yourname` or `checkpoint-3-teamname`
- Each game = 1 branch → we’ll have a nice collection to look at later.

## 🌟 What We’re Looking For
- Clear use of **OOP** (at least one class).
- Code that **runs without crashing**.
- Creativity! (Bonus points if it’s fun to play)
- **Do not** to use LLMs to generate the whole game for you. PLEASE.

---

## 💡 Tips
- Keep it **simple** — working > fancy.
- Use functions + classes to keep your code organized.  
- If you get stuck, fall back to the basics: loops, conditionals, input/output.

At the end, we’ll have a whole gallery of small games — should be fun to check out each other’s work! 🎮
