## Making Your Own Branch

[Create a Github Account](https://github.com/) 

(*Tips for beginners: Make sure your bash terminal is for the repository or else you will not have command line access to the repository, create a new folder on your desktop to then clone the repository into)

1. Clone this repository
      - Create and navigate into your onbaording folder in VS Code, from the terminal type **git clone url**, the URL will be from selecting the code button and then the https url from the main page
3. Add your own branch by going to branches on the github page, then selecting new branch. Make it your name.
4. git pull from your VS Code so that the new branch is recognized
5. git checkout you_branch_name to get onto your branch
6. Use git status to ensure you are NOT on main still before you make any changes. (Should say: Switched to branch 'your_branch_name'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/your_branch_name'.)
7. Change something on your branch and test adding, committing, and pushing a file to the remote repository.
