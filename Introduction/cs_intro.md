## Tutorials
- [VSCode set up guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
- [Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
- [Very Basic Python Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8?feature=shared)
        - I encourage you to take the time to learn Python more in depth, but for our purposes it makes more sense to direct your learning beyond this to the concepts needed rather than becoming proficient in the language as a whole.

- [Python Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) - Helpful for basic concepts you forget or didn't learn when they pop up
