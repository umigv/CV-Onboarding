# CV Onboarding
Onboarding resources for University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Team (2025-26) Computer Vision Subteam.

## How This Repository is Organized
The onboarding is divided into 6 sections:
1. **Introduction**: Introduces what the CV Subteam does, and how to get started.
2. **Setup**: Guides you through setting up your development environment.
3. **Programming**: Focuses on Python, followed by an intro to OpenCV and PyTorch.
4. **Classical Computer Vision**: Covers classical computer vision techniques using OpenCV.
5. **Machine Learning**: Focuses on PyTorch usage in our projects and important architectures.
6. **Integration**: Discusses how to integrate your work with other subteams and the overall project.

## How to Use This Repository
Completing each section is a three-step process:
1. **Read**: You will be assigned a section to read through. Complete the reading and take notes if required. Some sections may have videos to make it easier to follow along.
* Note that most sections have code snippets. You do not need to understand it all, but try to correlate it with the reading. The code is **mainly for reference** later on during projects.
2. **Complete Checkpoint**: After reading, make sure to complete the checkpoint for that section. This is usually a short task covering the main points of the section.
3. **Fill out the Form**: After completing the checkpoint, help us keep track by filling out this form: [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/). Also check the [Progress folder](/0_Progress/) to see onboarding progress of the team.

## General Schedule
The onboarding is designed to be completed over the course of **6 weeks**, with **one section per week**. However, this can be adjusted based on your availability and pace. The goal is to ensure you have a solid understanding of the material before moving on to the next section.
