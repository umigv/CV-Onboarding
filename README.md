# CV-Onboarding
Onboarding resources for University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Team (2024-25)

## Announcements:
1) If you skipped the computer science section make sure to still follow the make your own branch instruction inside of [Git Intro](https://github.com/umigv/CV-Onboarding/blob/main/Introduction/Git_intro.md)
2) IMPORTANT: A bug arose for the YOLO training notebooks in the last week. You *must* use the updated version of the YOLO notebooks and checkpoints in order for your code to work. We are not sure if this fix will become redundant and/or cause additional issues in the future, so please let Ryan or Matt know if you can't get the training stage to work. "TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'" likely means you are on the old notebooks.
3) We will add you to the dropbox on this Sunday's meeting

Hi everyone! Welcome to the team. Please go through onboarding sections that you have been assigned to get you prepared for the year. Please complete [this check in](https://forms.gle/yRPz1u5exbgAoyWV6) at the beginning of each meeting.

## Find a Project that Fits Your Interests:
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ef634SJfdRXIakzqJhP0OFhtHrR2Q5_G9onW3h-ZJHI/edit) is a list of projects that we are interested in pursuing as a team. As you move through onboarding it may be a good idea to read through this list to see what you are interested in and focus mostly on the onboarding that relates closely to the project. 

Additionally, we are always open to new projects and ideas so feel free to pitch any project to either Matt or Ryan at any time throughout the year.

2. [Using Julia for ARV](./Julia/julia_advanced.md)
- Let us know if you have any ideas for Julia projects you would like to pursue.



## Finished Onboarding
Once you have finished onboarding, navigate to [this link](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception) and familiarize yourself with the repository as this is where most of our projects and models will be kept. Make sure to carefully follow any instructions on the readme.
