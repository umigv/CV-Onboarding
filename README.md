# Machine Learning Model Leaderboard

This leaderboard showcases the performance of various models in terms of their Mean Average Precision (mAP) values.

| #   | mAP   | Creators              |
| --- | ----- | --------------------- |
| 1   | 0.85  | Alice, Bob            |
| 2   | 0.82  | Charlie, Dave         |
| 3   | 0.78  | Eve, Frank            |
| 4   | 0.76  | Grace, Henry          |
| 5   | 0.74  | Ivy, Jack             |

## How to Contribute

To add your model to the leaderboard, please create a pull request with the following information:
- Model name
- mAP value
- Names of the creators

Please make sure your mAP value is computed using the same dataset and evaluation metrics as the other models on this leaderboard.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The mAP value should be calculated based on [specific dataset name].
- All models should follow the same evaluation protocol to ensure fair comparison.
