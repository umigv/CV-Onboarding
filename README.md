# CV-Onboarding
Onboarding resources for University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Team (2024-25)

## Announcements:
1) If you skipped the computer science section make sure to still follow the make your own branch instruction inside of [Git Intro](https://github.com/umigv/CV-Onboarding/blob/main/Introduction/Git_intro.md)
2) We are aware of a current issue with training notebooks for YOLOv8, so the YOLO checkpoint will not work at this time, nor will the official notebooks
3) We will add you to the dropbox on this Sunday's meeting

Hi everyone! Welcome to the team. Please go through onboarding sections that you have been assigned to get you prepared for the year. Please complete [this check in](https://forms.gle/yRPz1u5exbgAoyWV6) at the beginning of each meeting.


## Tutorials:
1. [Background Information](./Introduction/background_info.md)
2. [Introduction to Computer Science](./Introduction/cs_intro.md)
3. [Introduction to Computer Vision](./Introduction/cv_intro.md)
4. [Introduction to Machine Learning](./Machine_Learning/ml_intro.md)
5. [Computer Vision Techniques](./CV_Techniques/cv_advanced.md)
6. [Advanced Machine Learning](./Machine_Learning/ml_advanced.md)

## Find a Project that Fits Your Interests:
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ef634SJfdRXIakzqJhP0OFhtHrR2Q5_G9onW3h-ZJHI/edit) is a list of projects that we are interested in pursuing as a team. As you move through onboarding it may be a good idea to read through this list to see what you are interested in and focus mostly on the onboarding that relates closely to the project. 

Additionally, we are always open to new projects and ideas so feel free to pitch any project to either Matt or Ryan at any time throughout the year.

Julia (Optional: for those interested in CV applications of computational programming)
1. [Introduction to Julia Programming](./Julia/julia_intro.md)
2. [Using Julia for ARV](./Julia/julia_advanced.md)
- Let us know if you have any ideas for Julia projects you would like to pursue.



## Finished Onboarding
Once you have finished onboarding, navigate to [this link](https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-ScenePerception) and familiarize yourself with the repository as this is where most of our projects and models will be kept. Make sure to carefully follow any instructions on the readme.
