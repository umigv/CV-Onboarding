| 5   | 0.74  | Ivy, Jack             |

## How to Contribute

To add your model to the leaderboard, please create a pull request with the following information:
- Model name
- mAP value
- Names of the creators

Please make sure your mAP value is computed using the same dataset and evaluation metrics as the other models on this leaderboard.

## Evaluation Criteria

- The mAP value should be calculated based on [specific dataset name].
- All models should follow the same evaluation protocol to ensure fair comparison.
